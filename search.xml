    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1234### relation between MMD and densityMMD: first-order informationDensity: second-order information, the larger variance, the sparser, the small variance, the densercombination of MMD and density: my understanding is that we can obtain MMD, density, prior weights from GMM, when GMM can be calculated from ground-trurh label of dataset A and pseudo label of dataset B GMM$ Gaussian Mixed Model: A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. One can think of mixture models as generalizing k-means clustering to incorporate information about the covariance structure of the data as well as the centers of the latent Gaussians. $applied to clusters and density estimation $differentce between k-means and GMM: k-means notes that each point is assigned to different clusters, while GMM can calculate the probabiliy of each point belong to each clusters. $import parameters of GMM: K Gaussion models, also K clusters, \pi_k, \mu_k, \Sigma_k\displaystyle\begin{aligned}p(x) &amp; = \sum_{k=1}^K p(k)p(x|k) \ &amp; = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x|\mu_k, \Sigma_k)\end{aligned}]]></content>
